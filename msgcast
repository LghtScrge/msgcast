First, he'd feel his chest suddenly ballooning outward, ripping through his clothes as a pair of small and sensitive boobs appeared down there, but he doesn't even have time to process the changes, as right after he'd feel his lower outfit starting to rip and tear, as his hips were becoming more wide, his thighs more thick, and his waist more narrow, kinda giving him the typical hourglass figure. Moreover, he couldn't help but get distracted by the new parts that were being added to his body, two pointy red horns starting to extend from the top sides of his cranium, and a pair of small wings also starting to form on his back! And in all of this \$n could just think about just how horny he was! Going to rub his cock, just to realize that...it was almost gone.

'She' was still sooooooooo horny though~ She didn't even need to think twice before she started fingering her new sex...too bad that she'd soon find out that it will be a bit harder reaching orgasm in her current form~ Oh well, her transformation is almost done, just have to wait a bit more~*","/cast [@player] Stoke Libido"],['\${MESSAGECAST.changeCharacterImage(0,"https://i.ibb.co/YF0gWBHQ/luxM2S5.png",{scale:"-1.1,1.1",backgroundSize:"auto 100%"})}',"/s *\$n's body had finally reached the last stage of her transformation, every part of her body starting to feel more natural, as if it always was like that in the first place, her sensitive deep crimson skin that got her more aroused as she simply moved around, her bat wings on her back fluttering excitedly at every horny thought, her tail rubbing its tip lewdly on her sensitive bits or on those of others just to tease...\$n was not finding anything wrong with all of those thoughts, they are part of what she is after all! And of course, the insatiable heat that had been feasting on her body up till now, and that is still quite present within her, hadn't gone away at all! But that was normal for her, after all, she had just been turned into a complete succubus now!

And a creature of pure seduction like her would never stand so low as to go against that core rule that every succubus certainly had! Sure, it had been a while since her last feeding, and she REALLY needed to find someone now, her pussy aching with desire simply with her standing there in place, but she could go for a bit longer...surely....nah, she can't~ It's hard to tell if her current look made her a dominant and seductive mistress that will take her semen one way or another from her toys, a meek whore begging for cocks and sex, or a failure of a succubus that won't be able to handle the overwhelming lust of her form and will simply end up part of the inventory of a greater being, but one thing's for sure, this succubus is REALLY horny right now, and if someone's nearby, they better be ready for it!*","\${MESSAGECAST.doUntil(\\"\${if(GAME_MANAGER.instance.actions.spells>=1){ACTION_BAR.TriggerMacro('','/cast [@player] Change Appearance: Feminine')}}\\",()=>{if(GAME_MANAGER.instance.character.genitalia==2){MESSAGECAST.doUntil(\\"\${if(GAME_MANAGER.instance.actions.spells>=1){ACTION_BAR.TriggerMacro('','/cast [@player] Mythic Form: Demon')}}\\",()=>{let curChar=GAME_MANAGER.instance.character.body; return curChar[0]==1&&curChar[2]==1&&curChar[3]==1;});}return GAME_MANAGER.instance.character.genitalia==2;});}"]];if(firstOneNow){for(let i in tfSequence[startFrom]){ACTION_BAR.TriggerMacro("",tfSequence[startFrom][i])}startFrom+=1;}let tmpInterval={};let intervalId = setInterval(()=>{if(startFrom>=tfSequence.length){MESSAGECAST.removeInterval(intervalId);}else{for(let i in tfSequence[startFrom]){ACTION_BAR.TriggerMacro("",tfSequence[startFrom][i])}startFrom+=1;if(startFrom>=tfSequence.length){MESSAGECAST.removeInterval(intervalId);}}},timeBetween);tmpInterval.id = intervalId;tmpInterval.name = "Interval"+intervalId;currentIntervals.push(tmpInterval);o="";}`,
